## Assembly

### Bills of materials

You'll need following parts in order to finish your board.

* 2 x 100R 0805 SMD resistors
* 1 x 1k 0805 SMD resistor
* 1 x SOT23-3 NPN Transistor
* 2 x 1206 LEDs (preferably white, change resistor according to your colour)
* 1 x Atttiny 84 SMD Version
* 1 x Pogopin Sparkfun Connector ([Link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11591))
* 1 x optionally a tiny loudspeaker

You can find the exact details in this [BOM](https://github.com/DigitalIdeationHSLU/DI8bitbox/blob/master/documentation/Warenkorb_juin13_0443.xls) Excel sheet.

### Soldering

With little soldering skills, you should be able to finish the board. Please be careful when mounting the LEDs and the Attiny, since orientation is important. See mounting diagram:

## Install

### Flashing Firmware

Attach the Pogo-pin programmer to an Arduino or another AVR ISP-capable programming device. For the wiring see this photo:

More infos here.

Once in place, prepare your Arduino by adding the Attiny to the list of boards. Here's a [HOWTO](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)

Make sure the Arduino settings are correct

![Arduino Settings](https://github.com/DigitalIdeationHSLU/DI8bitbox/blob/master/documentation/Arduino_Settings.png)

Press the Pogo pins gently onto the pads on the bottom side of the board. Again, orientation is important:

Hit the programming button within your Arduino sketch.

### Final preparation

Attach 3-5 Volts DC to the input pins where you'll find the battery icon. Make sure polarity is correct according to +/- signs. Solder the tiny loudspeaker on the other side of the board. You should hear sound coming out immediately.

## Run

Download either this [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jfedor.morsecode) for capturing sound or the [Morse Talk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueta.morsetransmitter&hl=fr) and hold it above one of the LEDs. You should be able to decrypt the message.
